## Summary
I began to study programming myself, and it turned out to be much more interesting than the specialty I study at the University.

My story began from HTML and [HTML Book](http://htmlbook.ru/). Then I realized that markup is not worth anything and CSS is required for page layout. I studied CSS with the help of the book “The Big Book of CSS3 3rd edition”. After CSS I investigated JavaScript - an interesting language! Then there were again books and the course “Fundamentals of Web UI Development” on Prometheus and many articles.

And my backend way started from Ruby and the book “Learn to Program” by Chris Pine. Though it seemed to me that this book was too simple I began to dig further: video tutorials on Ruby, and then Ruby on Rails, trying to do the same what the lecturer did.  Then I’ve applied to #pivorak summer Ruby course and has expanded my knowledge of Ruby (8 lectures, 4 workshops, 8 home tasks completed, both on Ruby and RoR).
